# Mayank Lal — Personal Website

This repository hosts the source code for my personal website:  https://mayanklal.com

The site serves as a living archive of my work across quantitative finance, risk modeling, data science, writing, and visual experimentation, built with an emphasis on clarity, structure, and long-form thinking.

## Purpose

This website is designed to:

- Present my professional profile and ongoing work
- Publish technical essays, whitepapers, and case studies
- Showcase projects, experiments, and visual explorations
- Act as a long-term knowledge repository rather than a static résumé

It evolves continuously alongside my learning, research, and creative output.

## Tech Stack

- Quarto — site generation and publishing
- Markdown / QMD — content authoring
- Custom CSS and JavaScript — typography, layout, and interactions
- GitHub Pages — hosting
- ChatGPT - For coding, editing and image generation

Typography and layout emphasize readability and timeless design over trends.

## Content Philosophy

- Depth over frequency
- Systems thinking over isolated tips
- Documentation over promotion
- Essays over short posts

Most content is written to remain relevant over time rather than optimized for short-term engagement.

## Project Status

This is an actively evolving project.

- Design, structure, and content are iterated incrementally
- Backward compatibility is preferred where possible
- Breaking changes may occur during major refactors

## Inspirations

I have been inspired my many personal websites to help me develop my own design language for my website. If you want to look at my inspirations, please visit the following websites:
- Niko Sirmpilatze (https://nikosirmpilatze.com/)
- Kailash Nadh (https://nadh.in/)
- Julia Silge (https://juliasilge.com/)

## Final Note

This site is not designed for quick consumption.
It is designed to compound over time.

If you are reading this repository, you are encouraged to explore slowly and get inspired to find your own design langugage.
