_Data Scientist · Quant · Storyteller_
:::

::: {.hero-summary}
I build quantitative models and write essays at the intersection of finance, mathematics, and systems thinking. My focus areas are credit risk modelling (PD/EAD/LGD), regulatory analytics (CCAR/CECL/IFRS9), climate risk stress testing and portfolio analytics.

This website is a repository of my quantitative stories to make complex ideas legible and human by blending anaytical rigor with narrative clarity. 

Hope you will enjoy reading it.
