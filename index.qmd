Hello World!

I’m **Mayank**, a Senior Data Scientist and Amateur Quantitative Storyteller.

I work on quantitative risk models, integrating behavioral and macroeconomic factors into risk frameworks. My focus areas are credit risk modelling (PD/LGD/EAD), regulatory analytics (CCAR/CECL/IFRS9), climate risk stress testing and portfolio analytics.

In my spare time, I try to weave stories using data, numbers and charts. This website is my attempt at creating a repository of my life using open source tools to be free from dictates of algorithms, vagaries of online platforms, and hustle culture of NPCs.
